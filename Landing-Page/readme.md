## Technologies and Tools Used

- **HTML5**: Used to build the structure of the page.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for responsive and modern design through utility-first CSS classes.
- **Font Awesome**: Used for adding icons.
- **JavaScript**: (Potentially used for future interactivity, though not implemented in this version).

## Project Structure and Features

### 1. **HTML File Structure**
- The HTML file starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration for compatibility and standards compliance.
- The `<head>` section includes:
  - Metadata such as charset and viewport for responsive design.
  - External CSS links: Tailwind's compiled CSS (`output.css`) and Font Awesome icons.

### 2. **Styling**
- **Tailwind CSS** is used extensively for:
  - **Background colors**: Classes like `bg-bg-color` and `bg-div-color` define the main color scheme.
  - **Text styling**: Utility classes like `text-xl`, `text-center`, and `font-medium` provide consistent typography.
  - **Flexbox and Grid**: Responsive layouts are created using `flex`, `gap`, `justify-between`, and other utility classes.
  - **Responsive Design**: Tailwind's responsive utilities (`xl:`, `lg:`, etc.) ensure the page adapts to various screen sizes.

### 3. **Components**
#### **Navbar**
- A navigation bar is implemented with:
  - **Logo**: A Font Awesome icon is used.
  - **Links**: Four navigation links, including a "Sign Up" button with a distinct color for emphasis.

#### **Hero Section**
- Divided into two parts:
  - **Left Panel**: Contains a title, description, input fields for name/email, and a "Join the waitlist" button.
  - **Right Panel**: Displays an image using `https://picsum.photos`.

#### **How It Works Section**
- Highlights a three-step process:
  - Each step is represented by a card with a number, title, and description.
  - Cards are styled with background colors and rounded corners.

#### **Testimonial Section**
- Displays:
  - A random image.
  - A blockquote for user feedback styled with Tailwind's utility classes.
  - A placeholder for the user's name and title.

#### **Content Section**
- Includes a call-to-action titled "Create with us."
- Contains descriptive text about the project's purpose or team vision.

#### **Blog Section**
- Divided into two columns:
  - **Image Section**: Displays an image using `https://picsum.photos`.
  - **Text Section**: Contains a "Business" badge, title, and details about the blog author and date.

#### **Final CTA Section**
- Encourages users to engage with the team.
- Features a headline, supporting text, and an image of the team.

#### **Footer**

  - **Brand Name**: "Mamba" is displayed as the footer logo.
